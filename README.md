# Autonomous Driving Research

## Overview
This repository contains my structured research work on autonomous vehicles, with a focus on deep learning and system-level understanding.  
It serves as a personal research portfolio documenting literature reviews, practical experiments, and insights toward pursuing a PhD in autonomous vehicle systems.
